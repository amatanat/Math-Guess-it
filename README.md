# Math- Guess it
The purpose of this app is to display:
* the usage of a Navigation library, 
* data passing between UI controllers using SafeArgs, 
* ViewModel implementation for the UI controller,
* UI controller communication with the ViewModel,
* Data binding usage
* Data binding and ViewModel direct communication.
* Furthermore, how to make data binding lifecycle aware and bind xml layouts to LiveData objects.
